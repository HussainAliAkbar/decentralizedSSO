Code Improvements:

1. Automate the mining and consensus protocols so that they do not need to be performed manually.
2. Replace Proof of Work with Proof of Stake to remove redundant mining.
3. Change normal array structure with Merkle Trees (Hash Trees).
4. Add validation that a consumer cannot create a serviceRegistration transaction for another consumer.
5. Add validation that a service cannot create a serviceRegistration transaction.

Idea Improvements:

1. Client and Admin SDK that will automate the fetching and sending api calls
2. Client Utility/ Browser Extension that will manage the public and private keys
3. Currency generated on the blockchain can be leveraged to pay the 3rd party services who use the SSO (not sure how though).
